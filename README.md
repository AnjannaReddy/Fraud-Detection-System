# Fraud-Detection-System

## 🧠 Overview
The **Fraud Detection System** is a machine learning project designed to detect **fraudulent financial transactions**.  
It applies **anomaly detection** and **classification techniques** to identify suspicious activities and prevent financial losses.  

By combining **statistical models, deep learning (Autoencoders)**, and **ensemble methods (XGBoost)**, this system builds a robust fraud detection pipeline that can handle **highly imbalanced data** effectively.

## 🎯 Goal
To predict and flag fraudulent transactions in financial data using **machine learning models** while minimizing false positives and handling class imbalance efficiently.
